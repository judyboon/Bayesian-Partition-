# Bayesian partition method to learn co-module in two matrices


## Introduction
This repository contains a software to find _co-module_ in two matrices
sharing a common dimension. 

Suppose we have two matrices _Y_ and _Z_ with
dimension _d_ by _g_ and _p_ by _g_ respectively. A co-module is a pair of sub-matrices
in _Y_ and _Z_ that share a significant pattern in contrast to other values. It is 
related to bi-cluster problems that divide a single matrix into non-overlapping
blocks that values within a block share similar pattern.
